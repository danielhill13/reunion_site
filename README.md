# reunion_site
for the Hill family reunion 2018

This project is my first "real world" go at web development. Having recently completed Colt Steele's Udemy course - The Web Developer Bootcamp - I'm working to drill into each area and built real sites. This one is not very pretty, my main focus has been on the server and db side of things.

Features:
- Landing page - done
- Destinations page - done
- Register, Login - done
- Password Reset/Email - need to learn this flow and implement
- Forum to create posts and comment/thread - In Progress
- Activities area, sign up, pay coordinators for deposits, fees, etc - TBD
- Where to go from here?
