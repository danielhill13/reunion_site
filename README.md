# reunion_site
### for the Hill family reunion 2018

This project is my first "real world" go at web development. Having recently completed Colt Steele's Udemy course - The Web Developer Bootcamp - I'm working to drill into each area and built real sites. This one is not very pretty, my main focus has been on the server and db features.

#### Using Node, Express, and Mongo I've built a simple website to coordinate my extended family's reunion coming up summer of 2018. The primary goals (outside of cementing knowledge) are:
1. Display information and media about the destination (done)
2. Provide a topics/comment thread area to share ideas and comment to each other (done)
3. Create an Events and RSVP space where people can sign up for various activities (future)
4. Direct people to services for reimbursing the deposit-makers, event coordinators, etc (future)
5. Make it mobile-friendly - work in progress!
6. Make it look nice - I'm pretty lost on the design
7. Collaborate with stakeholder (my cousin's wife providing requirements, copy, and images)



Open to any and all feedback!
